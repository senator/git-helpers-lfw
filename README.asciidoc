Git Helpers by Lebbeous Fogle-Weekley (git-helpers-lfw)
=======================================================

The tools
---------
These tools are rough shortcuts for certain operations with 'git' in UNIX-like
systems.

Put them somewhere in your $PATH and you can invoke them just like other git
commands (i.e., `git credit` and `git ff` and so on).

git-credit
~~~~~~~~~~
Summarizes the information you would get from git blame about one or more
tracked files.  Shows you the percentage of the total of lines in each file
for which each author is responsible.

git-ff
~~~~~~
Fast-foward your local tracking branch to the HEAD of the remote tracked
branch.  Just shorthand for the full `git pull <remote> <branch>` command.

git-find
~~~~~~~~
git-find is to find as git-grep is to grep.

If you run it like so `git find myscript.pl` the `-name` test is implied.

You can, however, run it like
`git find -iname maybecamelcaseorsomething* -and -mmin 30`

git-mlog
~~~~~~~~
Probably the least useful of the set of tools here, git-mlog is simply git-log
with a certain, hardcoded single-line format for output that I happen to like.

git-untrack
~~~~~~~~~~~
For the current local branch, drop tracking information about a remote branch.
